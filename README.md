# The Personal Distance Monitor

## Inventing a way to help with social distancing and personal space intrusion issues for students with ASD.

Hi! Welcome to the repository of the 2020 Smithtown West Lemelson-MIT InvenTeam. During the summer of 2020 in the middle of a global pandemic, we decided to tackle accessibility issues in the prevention of catching Covid-19. Specifically, we wanted to make it easier to teach social distancing and personal space to those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). 

The project consists of an arduino uno hooked up with an IR sensor, an ultrasonic rangefinder, and a vibration motor. These sensors are neatly packaged in an easy to use 3D printed container. Using these sensors, the user can recieve real time feedback when they get too close to another person. The threshold for distance will be adjustable through an app designed to be used by the caretaker of the student.

This project will be useful even after the Covid-19 pandemic, as personal space issues is common amongst those with ASD.

## How to use
Currently, this repository is a work in progress. Downloadable code, detailed documentation, and .STL files for case manufacturing are coming soon!

## Future Plans
-  New case with far smaller size to avoid stigma

- Improving app to monitor progress over time by seeing number of vibrations that occur daily
- Web application for caretakers to monitor progress of a multitude of students at a time
